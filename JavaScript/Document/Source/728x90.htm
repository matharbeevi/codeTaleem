                    <p class="secound">Inform your healthcare provider of the following, before you receive treatment with <em class="no-wrap">ORENCIA:</em></p>
                    
                    <p class="third"><span class="title">Infections:</span> If you have any kind of infection even if it is small (such as an open cut or sore), an infection that is in your whole body (such as the flu), an infection that will not go away, or a history of infections that keep coming back. ORENCIA may make your immune system less able to fight infections, so you may be more likely to get infections or any infection you have may get worse.</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="title">Tuberculosis:</span> If you have had tuberculosis (TB), a positive skin test for TB, or if you recently have been in <u>close</u> contact with someone who has had TB. If you get any of the symptoms of TB (a cough that does not go away, weight loss, fever, night sweats), call your healthcare provider right away. Before you start ORENCIA, your healthcare provider may examine you for TB or perform a skin test.</p>
                    
					<p>If you have or have had <span class="title">Viral Hepatitis</span>. Before you use ORENCIA, your healthcare provider may examine you for hepatitis.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you have a history of <span class="title">Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary (lung) Disease (COPD)</span>.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you are scheduled to have <span class="title">Surgery</span>.</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="title">Allergies to the Ingredients of ORENCIA:</span> The ingredients of intravenous (IV) ORENCIA are: abatacept, maltose, monobasic sodium phosphate, and sodium chloride for administration. The ingredients of subcutaneous (SC) ORENCIA are: abatacept, sucrose, poloxamer 188, monobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate, dibasic sodium phosphate anhydrous, and water for injection.</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="title">Vaccinations:</span> If you have recently received a vaccination or are scheduled for any vaccination. If you are receiving ORENCIA, and for 3 months after you stop receiving ORENCIA, you should not take live vaccines.</p>
                    
					<p><span class="title">Diabetes:</span> If you have diabetes and use a blood glucose monitor to check your sugar levels. The <span class="bold">infusion</span> of ORENCIA contains maltose, a sugar that can give falsely high blood glucose readings with some monitors on the day you receive your infusion. Your healthcare provider may tell you to use a different way to monitor your <u>blood</u> sugar levels. ORENCIA for SC injection does not contain maltose; therefore, you do not need to change the way you monitor your blood sugar if you are taking ORENCIA subcutaneously.</p>
                       
                    <p><span class="title">Pregnancy:</span> If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if ORENCIA can harm your unborn baby. If you took ORENCIA during pregnancy, talk to your healthcare provider before your baby receives any vaccines.</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="title">Breastfeeding:</span> It is not known if ORENCIA passes into your breastmilk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you use ORENCIA.</p>
                    
					<p>If you <span class="title">Take Any Other Kinds of Medicine</span>, including prescription and <em class="no-wrap">over-the-counter</em> medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you are <span class="title">Taking Other Biologic Medicines to Treat RA</span> such as: Enbrel<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;(etanercept), Humira<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;(adalimumab), Remicade<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;(infliximab), Kineret<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;(anakinra), Rituxan<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;(rituximab), Simponi<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;(golimumab), Cimzia<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;(certolizumab pegol), or Actemra<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;(tocilizumab). You may have a higher chance of getting a serious infection if you take ORENCIA with other biologic medicines.</p>
